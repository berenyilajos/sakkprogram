How to start the chess program:

The program has been made with Java 8, so the running condition is the JRE 8 (Windows) or JDK 8 (Windows, Linux, Mac OS) installation.

-Windows: doubleclick on the chesschamp.exe ( the Windows may not show the .exe extension! ).

-Linux (Debian-based), for example. Ubuntu, Linux Mint: doubleclick on the chesschamp_start.sh, then Run or Run in the Terminal.
  Thought by default it is set, at the properties -> entitlements you may need to mark the
  "Enabling the exetution of the file as a program" check box.
  Start from terminal: after the entry of the directory - "cd PATH_TO_THE_DIRECTORY/chesschamp" -, run: "./chesschamp_start.sh".
  Before that, though by default it is set to, it is possible, the command "chmod + x chesschamp_start.sh" is necessary to make the file executable.

-Mac OS and not Debian-based Linux systems: it is identical to the Linux's start from terminal:
  After the entry of the directory - "cd PATH_TO_THE_DIRECTORY/chesschamp" -, run: "./chesschamp_start.sh".
  Before that, though by default it is set to, it is possible, the command "chmod + x chesschamp_start.sh" is necessary to make the file executable.

Up to 200 ( 200-200 white and black ) moves may be done in a game,
but this is only theoretical limit, because a game with 60 moves is already very long!
