How to install the chess program:
Run the chesschampsetup.exe!

The program has been made with Java 8, so the running condition is the JRE 8 or JDK 8 installation!

Up to 200 ( 200-200 white and black ) moves may be done in a game,
but this is only theoretical limit, because a game with 60 moves is already very long!
